This is a simple test to check the implementation of the strider.sv module
Use cmd: gtkwave sim.fst in root

Base adress before stride: 00000000

Applying window at the adress......
Move window 3 down and 4 right with stride of 2
Calculated adress after stride: 0004000E

Applying window at the new adress......
Move window 3 down and 4 right with stride of 2
Calculated adress after stride: 0004001C

Applying window at the new adress......
Simulation finished
